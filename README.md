## **Visualizing Earthquake Data**

This project visualizes weekly earthquake data from USGS, agency responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change.

## **Tasks**

The project consists of two sets of visualizations:

### **Leaflet-Step-1**

This task involves the development of a single layer map highlighting earthquake magnitude by marker (circle) size and depth of tremor by color intensity of the markers.

The map also displays a legend representing the depth of the tremors as seen above.

### **Leaflet-Step-2**

This task involves developing a three base-layer map of both earthquake data and that of continental tectonic plates.

The interactive map contains orange polygons as markers together with all the features of the previous map.
